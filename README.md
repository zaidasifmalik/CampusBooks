# CampusBooks
We often observe in universities that student of different semester exchange books with each other when the new semester starts. This is because paying full price for a new book which you are going to use for maximum 3-4 months isnâ€™t a good idea. Me and my team developed a website where students could buy, exchange, or sell their used books
